{"name":"Book Library","tagline":"Solving the problem of which book to buy for a bibliophile.","body":"### The Premise\r\nBuying books is hard - what if the person already owns it, or you don't know what their taste is like? Simple - check out the list of all books they own in an easy to use app or site.\r\n\r\n### Accounts\r\nTo get set up just make an account - easy as! Then scan a barcode or enter an ISBN, and it'll add it to your lists. You can search users via email address, and once you're on a page just type in an author/title to search their list.\r\n\r\n### Languages\r\nThe Android App uses the Java SDK, the website front-end is basic HTML/CSS/Javascript, and the back end is a MySQL database.\r\n\r\n### Authors and Contributors\r\n@bethc struggles to buy @AvengingSyndrome books he doesn't already own. So instead of just not buying him books, they built an easy way of checking which books he has.","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file! It's used internally to help with page regeneration."}
