        <h3>The Premise</h3>

<p>Buying books is hard - what if the person already owns it, or you don't know what their taste is like? Simple - check out the list of all books they own in an easy to use app or site.</p>

<h3>Accounts</h3>

<p>To get set up just make an account - easy as! Then scan a barcode or enter an ISBN, and it'll add it to your lists. You can search users via email address, and once you're on a page just type in an author/title to search their list.</p>

<h3>Languages</h3>

<p>The Android App uses the Java SDK, the website front-end is basic HTML/CSS/Javascript, and the back end is a MySQL database.</p>

<h3>Authors and Contributors</h3>

<p><a href="https://github.com/bethc" class="user-mention">@bethc</a> struggles to buy <a href="https://github.com/AvengingSyndrome" class="user-mention">@AvengingSyndrome</a> books he doesn't already own. So instead of just not buying him books, they built an easy way of checking which books he has.</p>
